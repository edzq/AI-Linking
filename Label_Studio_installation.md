# 1. Install the Label-studio

Install the Label-studio in your laptop. You can visit their website: [https://labelstud.io/](https://labelstud.io/)

- Make sure you have a fit Python environment. For example, Python 3.6+ and anaconda. If you have, you can just create one virtual environment to install label-studio. The following is installation example:

```python
# Install the package
# into python virtual environment
pip install -U label-studio
# Launch it!
label-studio
```

Then you can start the label-studio in your browser. I am today busy in the Conference of SIGMOD with our professor. I need more works to finish the first round data generation for you.

So you can install the label-studio firstly. If you have any problem please feel free to email me. I will try my best to help.
